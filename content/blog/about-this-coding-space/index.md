import {Link} from "gatsby"

## Introduction
This is a web space for displaying my portfolio projects and sharing articles about web app coding such as Javascript、Vue、React.

## How to use:
- The <Link to='/portfolio'>Portfolio</Link> page introduces my backgrounds, technical communities that I have been taking part in, and showcasing some personal side projects.  
- In the <Link to='/blog'>Blog</Link> page, it logged articles that are related to Javascript、Vue、React.  
- <Link to='/categories'>Categories</Link> page display articles in the order by the date upon creation.
- <Link to='/rss.xml'>RSS File</Link> is available here so this blog can be followed by using RSS reader.

I built this Gatsby site ([Gatsby's Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)) and use Notion API ([Notion's Docs](https://www.notion.so)) to get articles from Notion database, and deploy by Netlify ([Netlify's Docs](https://www.netlify.com)) so it's easy to set up and maintain to me.

```javascript
let author = "Rachel_Chen"
```
