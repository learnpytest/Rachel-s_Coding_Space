## Introduction
This is a web space for displaying portfolio projects showcase and sharing articles about web app coding such as Javascript、Vue、React.

## How to use:
- The `Portfolio` page introduces my study / working expriences and showcasing personal front end projects.  
- In the `Blog` page, it logged articles that are related to Javascript、Vue、React.  
- The `Community` page are some study clubs、technical communities that I have taken part in during my journey of learning web app development. 

I built this Gatsby site ([Gatsby's Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)) and use Notion API ([Notion's Docs](https://www.notion.so)) to get articles from Notion database, and deploy by Netlify ([Netlify's Docs](https://www.netlify.com)) so it's easy to set up and maintain to me.
